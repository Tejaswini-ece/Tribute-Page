          <h2>A Tribute to the Genius Who Changed the World of Physics</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Albert Einstein</b> was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany. He was a theoretical physicist who is widely regarded as one of the most brilliant
            and influential scientists in history. Einstein developed the theory of relativity, which, along with quantum mechanics, forms the foundation of
            modern physics. He became famous for his mass-energy equivalence formula, <b>E = mc²</b>, often referred to as the most famous equation in the world.
            Despite facing challenges early in life and during times of great political unrest, his relentless curiosity and profound insights reshaped the way
            we understand space, time, and the universe.
